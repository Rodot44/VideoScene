# 🎥 VideoScene: Distilling Video Diffusion Model to Generate 3D Scenes in One Step

![VideoScene Banner](https://example.com/banner-image.png)

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to VideoScene! This project focuses on advancing the field of video generation by distilling a video diffusion model to create 3D scenes in a single step. The goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of 3D reconstruction from video inputs.

### 🔑 Key Features

- **3D Reconstruction**: Generate 3D scenes from video data seamlessly.
- **Video Generation**: Enhance video content creation with innovative models.
- **Single-step Process**: Streamlined workflow for generating 3D scenes.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get started with VideoScene, follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the model.

### 📦 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pytorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

### 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rodot44/VideoScene.git
cd VideoScene
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🚀 Usage

To use VideoScene, you need to download the latest release. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Rodot44/VideoScene/releases) to get the necessary files.

After downloading, execute the following command to run the model:

```bash
python main.py --input <video_file_path> --output <output_scene_path>
```

Replace `<video_file_path>` with the path to your input video and `<output_scene_path>` for the output 3D scene.

## 🔍 Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the project structure:

```
VideoScene/
├── main.py             # Main script to run the model
├── requirements.txt    # List of dependencies
├── utils/              # Utility functions
│   ├── data_loader.py  # Functions for loading video data
│   └── model.py        # Model definitions
└── README.md           # Documentation for the project
```

## 📈 Results

Below are some examples of the 3D scenes generated from various video inputs:

| Input Video | Generated 3D Scene |
|-------------|---------------------|
| ![Input 1](https://example.com/input1.png) | ![Scene 1](https://example.com/scene1.png) |
| ![Input 2](https://example.com/input2.png) | ![Scene 2](https://example.com/scene2.png) |

### 📊 Performance Metrics

The performance of VideoScene can be evaluated using several metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the difference between the generated and ground truth scenes.
- **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**: Assesses the visual quality of the generated scenes.
